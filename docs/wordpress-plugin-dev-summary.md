# WordPress Plugin Development Workflow Summary

## **The Issue at Hand**
You are currently developing a WordPress plugin using a modern build system (`webpack`, `package.json`, `wp-scripts`, `node/npm tasks`) and working outside of a WordPress instance. Your workflow involves:
- Building the plugin.
- Porting it to a WordPress instance for testing (which takes ~10 minutes per iteration).
- Repeating this process for every feature or bug fix.

This workflow is time-consuming and inefficient, especially for iterative development. You are seeking a way to simplify and streamline the process, ideally developing in a live environment with hot reloading.

You are also at a critical decision point:
- The plugin is still early in development, and its history (mostly project setup and architecture) isn’t crucial at this stage.
- However, future development may require preserving history if the plugin becomes a standalone project or is reused elsewhere.

## **Options for Simplifying the Workflow**

### **Option 1: Develop the Plugin Within a WordPress Theme**
- Move the plugin code into an active WordPress theme’s directory (e.g., `wp-content/themes/your-theme/plugin-code`).
- Integrate it into the theme’s `functions.php` and use hot reloading for live development.
- Treat the plugin as part of the theme during development.

### **Option 2: Keep the Plugin Standalone but Symlink It**
- Keep the plugin in its own repository.
- Use a symbolic link (symlink) to link the plugin directory to the `wp-content/plugins` folder of a local WordPress installation.
- Develop the plugin as a standalone project while benefiting from a live WordPress environment.

### **Option 3: Merge the Plugin Repository Into the Theme Repository**
- Merge the plugin’s repository into the theme’s repository, preserving its history.
- Move the plugin code into the theme’s directory structure.
- Develop the plugin as part of the theme while keeping its history intact.

### **Option 4: Copy the Plugin Without Preserving History**
- Simply copy the plugin code into the theme’s directory (without copying the `.git` folder).
- Start fresh in the theme’s repository, without merging or preserving the plugin’s history.

### **Option 5: Use Git Submodules**
- Add the plugin repository as a Git submodule in the theme repository.
- Keep the plugin’s history intact while maintaining a clear separation between the theme and plugin.

## **Cost / Benefit Analysis of Each Option**

### **Option 1: Develop Within a Theme**
- **Cost**: Minimal setup; requires integrating the plugin into the theme.
- **Benefit**: Simplifies development with hot reloading and eliminates the need for porting.

### **Option 2: Keep Standalone but Symlink**
- **Cost**: Requires symlink setup and possibly minor adjustments for paths in the plugin code.
- **Benefit**: Preserves the plugin’s independence while enabling live development in WordPress.

### **Option 3: Merge Repositories**
- **Cost**: Requires merging histories; may result in a cluttered Git history.
- **Benefit**: Retains plugin history and integrates it into the theme for streamlined development.

### **Option 4: Copy Without Preserving History**
- **Cost**: Loses plugin history (but the original repository can serve as a backup).
- **Benefit**: Simple and quick; ideal if history isn’t critical at this stage.

### **Option 5: Use Submodules**
- **Cost**: Slightly more complex workflow; additional steps to manage submodules.
- **Benefit**: Keeps plugin and theme repositories separate while maintaining history.

## **Pros and Cons of Each Option**

### **Option 1: Develop Within a Theme**
- **Pros**:
  - Simplifies development (hot reloading enabled).
  - Easy setup for testing in a live WordPress environment.
  - No need to port code between projects.
- **Cons**:
  - Tight coupling between plugin and theme.
  - May complicate future separation of the plugin from the theme.

### **Option 2: Keep Standalone but Symlink**
- **Pros**:
  - Preserves the plugin’s modularity and independence.
  - Allows live development without porting.
  - Compatible with hot reloading.
- **Cons**:
  - Requires symlink setup.
  - Paths in plugin code may need adjustment (e.g., file includes).

### **Option 3: Merge Repositories**
- **Pros**:
  - Retains plugin history for future traceability.
  - Integrates the plugin into the theme for streamlined development.
- **Cons**:
  - Merging histories can be complex.
  - Clutters the theme repository with plugin-specific commits.
  - Tight coupling between plugin and theme.

### **Option 4: Copy Without Preserving History**
- **Pros**:
  - Clean slate for plugin development.
  - Simple and quick to implement.
  - Ideal for early-stage projects with minimal history.
- **Cons**:
  - Loses plugin history (setup, architecture decisions, etc.).
  - May complicate future reuse or extraction of the plugin.

### **Option 5: Use Submodules**
- **Pros**:
  - Keeps plugin and theme repositories independent.
  - Retains plugin history while allowing integration into the theme.
  - Easier to update or replace the plugin in the future.
- **Cons**:
  - More complex than other options.
  - Requires managing submodule references and updates.

## **Final Thoughts**
The decision ultimately depends on your priorities:
1. **Short-Term Simplicity**: Options 1 and 4 are the easiest to implement now but may require more effort later to separate the plugin.
2. **Long-Term Flexibility**: Options 2, 3, and 5 preserve the plugin’s modularity and history, making it easier to scale or reuse in the future.

If you expect the plugin to grow in complexity or be reused in other projects, **Option 2 (symlink)** or **Option 5 (submodules)** offers the best balance of flexibility and streamlined development.
